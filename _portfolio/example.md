Base Notions in Statistics: Population, Statistical Units, and Distribution
Statistics is the study of data and the techniques used to gather, analyze, interpret, and present it. At its core, it involves three fundamental concepts: population, statistical units, and distribution.

1. Population
In statistics, the term population refers to the complete set of entities or observations that are of interest in a particular study. These entities could be individuals, objects, events, or data points. For example, in a medical study about diabetes, the population could be all individuals diagnosed with diabetes in a particular country.

Finite Population: A population with a limited number of observations. For example, all students in a university.
Infinite Population: A population that theoretically contains an infinite number of elements. An example would be measuring the height of all humans that will ever exist.
The population is what we aim to draw conclusions about, but often it's too large to observe entirely, so we use a sample, which is a subset of the population, to infer results about the whole.

2. Statistical Units
A statistical unit is the individual entity on which data is collected. These could be people, companies, products, or measurements. For example, if you're conducting a survey on household income, a statistical unit would be each household surveyed.

Each statistical unit must be:

Well-defined, meaning that there should be no ambiguity in what constitutes a unit.
Comparable, so that the same kind of data can be gathered for every unit.
3. Distribution
A distribution describes how values of a variable are spread or dispersed within a population or sample. It indicates the frequency with which different outcomes or measurements occur. Distributions help statisticians understand patterns in data and are crucial in probability theory.

Probability Distribution: Shows the probability of different outcomes. For example, a normal distribution (also called a Gaussian distribution) is one of the most common in statistics and represents many real-world variables like test scores or heights of people.
Empirical Distribution: Based on observed data rather than a theoretical model. The histogram of observed values in a sample is an example of an empirical distribution.
Distributions can also be described by characteristics such as:

Mean (average)
Variance (spread)
Skewness (asymmetry)
Kurtosis (peakedness)
